HTML has predefined tags , each and every tag has different role we have to just add our content inti that.

h1 : is tag
class : is attribute

### BY using only html we can create only static web pages , it will look black and white like old school news paper.
### To add some style we have to add .css file, here we can do lot of syling to any html tags like colour of content , background colour hight , width etc.
### To add some dynamic nature to your web sight we have to add javascript so we can perform some logical operation and manipulate DOM (Document object model).
